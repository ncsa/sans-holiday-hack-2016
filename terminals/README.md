# Tools for the CranPi Terminals

## General
  - tty\_oneshot.py: Runs a command on one of the terminals. Note that this won't work on the Train consoles, which require a user-specific QUEST_UID.
  
## Wumpus
  - srand.c: Used with LD\_PRELOAD to fix the random seed so that the Wumpus game is always the same.
